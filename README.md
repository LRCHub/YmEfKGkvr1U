```lrc
[00:43.84] Sitting by the palm trees in the last oasis
[00:47.55] Visions into my fantasy full of mystery
[00:52.12] Dune after dune in the ocean of yellow sand
[00:56.26] Wind is blowing silently in the Sahara land
[01:17.76] 
[01:00.29] Camel by camel
[01:05.07] Camel by camel
[01:12.07] 
[01:18.60] I try not to remember, no memories
[01:22.48] I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
[01:27.26] (Camel by camel) I'll agree with places of perfect harmony
[01:30.68] (Camel by camel) For me the night is changing my mystery
[01:58.68] 
[01:44.34] I can fly all over a golden desert sea
[01:48.42] I feel good in my loneliness, just keeping me
[01:53.02] Colors and perfumes in a crazy romance
[01:57.28] The caravans moving easily in a camel dance
[02:18.78] 
[02:02.17] Camel by camel
[02:06.15] Camel by camel
[02:13.15] 
[02:45.97] I try not to remember, no memories
[02:49.56] I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
[02:54.14] (Camel by camel) I'll agree with places of perfect harmony
[02:58.30] (Camel by camel) For me the night is changing my mystery
[03:26.30] 
[03:56.26] Sitting by the palm trees in the last oasis
[03:59.62] Visions into my fantasy full of mystery
[04:04.68] Dune after dune in the ocean of yellow sand
[04:08.44] Wind is blowing silently in the Sahara land
[04:29.94] 
[04:12.28] Camel by camel
[04:16.91] Camel by camel
[04:23.91] 
[04:30.74] I try not to remember, no memories
[04:34.33] I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
[04:39.11] (Camel by camel) I'll agree with places of perfect harmony
[04:43.37] (Camel by camel) For me the night is changing my mystery
[05:11.37] 
[04:48.27] I try not to remember, no memories
[04:52.25] I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
[04:56.22] (Camel by camel) I'll agree with places of perfect harmony
[05:01.07] (Camel by camel) For me the night is changing my mystery
